# JobListing Backend

## Overview

**JobListing** is a Spring Boot-based backend service that enables users to list jobs and search for jobs based on various criteria. The project is designed to allow job seekers to explore job opportunities by typing in keywords, and job posters to add detailed job listings. This backend service connects to a MongoDB Atlas database and is structured using the Maven build system. The API documentation is integrated with Swagger2 and Swagger UI for easy interaction and testing of the endpoints.
